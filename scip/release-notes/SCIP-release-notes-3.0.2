Notes for SCIP Release 3.0.2


Interface Changes
=================

- removed problematic function SCIPsetSlackVarIndicator() from cons_indicator


Features
========

- can now output the solutions in the solution pool in the interactive shell

- updated Mosek LP interface to compile with Mosek 7

- display some syntax errors when reading erroneous CIP files

- cons_xor now uses the integral variable in propagation

- added methods SCIPmarkColNotRemovableLocal() and SCIPmarkRowNotRemovableLocal()
  to forbid removal of a column/row from the LP in the current node


Bug Fixes
=========

- fixed bug in cons_integral: check integrality of implicit integer variables when
  a solution is checked for feasibility

- fixed bugs in parsing bounds from CIP-files, in reader_gms, and AMPL interface

- fixed bugs with freeing C++ object data for problem and variables

- fixed bugs in solution counting

- forbid branching on variables with huge bounds

- unlinking a solution now copies values smaller than SCIPepsilon() to avoid that
  feasible solutions in the transformed problem become infeasible in the original
  problem

- many small bug fixes, see CHANGELOG
