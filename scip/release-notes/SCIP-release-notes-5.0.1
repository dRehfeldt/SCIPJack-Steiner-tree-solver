Notes for SCIP Release 5.0.1


Performance Improvements
========================

- Increased threshold to scale up cuts that are generated by nonlinear constraint handlers

- Disable disaggregation of quadratic constraints by default
  (disaggregation can still be very helpful on some instances, but also seems hurtful on others)


Additional Notes
================

- Expanded unit tests

- Many bug fixes, see CHANGELOG
