Notes for SCIP Release 3.2


Features
========

- added reoptimization feature for optimization problems with changed objective function or tighter feasible region

- new primal heuristics distribution diving, indicator, bound

- improved clique and variable bound heuristics

- new branching rules distribution, multaggr and a new rule for SOS1 constraints

- new separator eccuts

- new presolvers tworowbnd, dualagg, implfree, redvub, stuffing

- added presolving levels (FAST, MEDIUM, and EXHAUSTIVE) to allow better balancing of presolvers

- generalized upgrade from (SOC-representable) quadratic constraints to SOC constraints

- extended probing mode to allow separation and objective coefficient changes

- transfer of history information from and to sub-SCIPs

- new reliability notions in hybrid reliability pseudo cost branching

- started support for user-defined operators in expression trees/graphs

- added matrix module for getting access to the internal mixed inter linear problem matrix

- two new applications for multi-objective optimization (PolySCIP) and the Steiner Tree Problem in Graphs

- added output information for BAK: Branch-and-bound Analysis Kit


Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- decreasing total memory usage of SCIP by using more buffer data structures

- adjust diving heuristics to solve fewer LPs

- improved vartype upgradability from continuous to implicit variables

- using sparsity information of the SoPlex LP

- new presolving/propagation algorithm using the gcd for ranged rows and equations in cons_linear

- improved treatment of nonlinearities in hybrid reliability pseudo cost branching

- improved propagation of SOS1 constraint handler using the information from a conflict graph

- improved separation procedure of SOS1 constraint handler

- improved separation procedure for convex quadratic constraints

- better presolving coordination by presolving levels

- and many bug fixes, see CHANGELOG


Additional Notes
================

- moved some examples to an application directory

- original problem can now be permuted directly after reading

- better handling of large values returned by the LP solver

- extended statistic output of interactive shell
