Notes for SCIP Release 5.0

Features
========

- SCIP can now automatically detect and exploit symmetries in MIPs

- add new heuristic MPEC that solves a MPEC reformulation of a mixed-binary nonlinear problem by regularized NLP reformulations

- new primal heuristic ALNS that orchestrates eight different LNS heuristics adaptively
  using algorithms for the multi-armed bandit problem

- added analysis of the clique table which identifies possible aggregations via the search for
  strongly connected components and may detect infeasible assignments on the way

- new presolving plugin presol_sparsify that tries to cancel nonzero coefficients in linear constraints by adding
  multiples of linear equalities

- utilizing linear inequalities to compute stronger linearizations for bilinear terms; the inequalities are computed in
  the OBBT propagator

- extended conflict analysis by analyzing dual solutions of boundexceeding LPs

- improved cut post-processing: apply coefficient tightening, enforce maximal dynamism

- added interface to the NLP solver WORHP

- added interface to the NLP solver FilterSQP

- added new plugin type "table" for adding user-defined statistics tables

- added macros to do computations with a higher precision by using double-double arithmetic

- new methods and interactive shell functionality to display linear constraint classification types;
  use SCIPclassifyConstraintTypesLinear() or 'display linclass' after reading a problem to classify linear constraint types

- new numerical solution violations get printed when checksol is called


Performance Improvements
========================

- new implementation of zerohalf separator

- faster implementation of CMIR cut generation heuristic

- improved cut selection and management

- enabled MIP cutting plane separation in the tree

- disabled reformulation of products of a binary variable with a linear term that does not solely involve binary variables

- improved dual ray analysis

- use disjoint set to reduce peak memory usage and time to compute clique table connectedness information

- revised disaggregation of quadratic constraints: the number of created constraints can now be controlled and the
  disaggregated constraints are scaled in order to increase numerical accuracy

- removed bestrelaxsol and directly access relaxation solution instead to decrease overhead when using relaxation handlers

- use LP solution polishing during probing and diving mode to activate it during many primal heuristics; remains disabled
  during strong branching and OBBT

- for fast presolving emphasis, disable use of implications in logicor presolving

- use limit on the total number of nonzeros added to the clique table during the greedyCliqueAlgorithm of cons_knapsack.c

- speed up creation of LP in the computation of relative interior points

- drop events of disabled linear constraints to reduce event processing effort

- improved versions of the clique and variable bound pre-root heuristics that are often able to fix many more variables


Additional Notes
================

- default value for ZIMPL in the Makefile is now "false"

- added compilation flag SYM to specify which graph automorphism package (bliss, none) should be used

- improved Visual Studio compilation with CMake build system

- several new unit tests

- Many bug fixes, see CHANGELOG
