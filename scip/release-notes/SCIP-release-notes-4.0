Notes for SCIP Release 4.0

Features
========

- Introduced support for partial or infeasible user solutions, which SCIP tries to complete/repair heuristically

- Many improvements and new example code for custom relaxation handlers

- Improved conflict analysis through central conflict pool and dual ray analysis for primal infeasible LPs

- New solution polishing to improve integrality of LP solutions

- New Concurrent solving mode to launch several SCIPs with different settings in parallel

- Added adaptive solving behavior of SCIP based on solving phases and heuristic transitions

- New constraint handlers cardinality and components

- New primal heuristics GINS, LP face, Complete Sol, Locks, Repair, and Multistart

- Revised pseudo random number generation and introduced central random seed for all plugins

- New presolvers that disaggregate SOC constraints and reformulate QP's by adding KKT conditions

- New presolving step for variables contained in a single quadratic constraint with proper square coefficients

- New separators for gauge cuts, convex projection cuts and perspective cuts for indicator constraints

- New propagator for OBBT on convex NLP relaxation

- Extended statistic output displayable via the interactive shell

- Additional I/O-functionalities for debugging and logging in SCIP and in the AMPL interface

- Added new debug output function SCIPdebugMsg that outputs the sub-SCIP level; now used within SCIP


Performance Improvements
========================

- Improved tuning of propagation and heuristic timings

- Constraint compression reduces memory usage in problem copies used inside primal heuristics

- Linear time methods for (weighted) median selection and inplace partitioning of joint arrays of various types, used for knapsack approximation algorithms

- Improved greedy knapsack solution for the flow cover separation

- Connectedness of the clique table for faster and better clique partitioning

- Extended the presolving timings by an additional timing FINAL for self-contained reductions

- Improved and extended stuffing inside of linear constraint handler

- Tuned propagation methods of several constraint handlers and the absolute-value expression

- Changed handling of coupling constraints in cons_indicator

- Clique separator always constructs a dense clique table, which proved to be faster on several MIP benchmarks

- 1-opt heuristic is iterated as long as new incumbents are found

- Randomized tie-breaking in different parts of the code to reduce performance variability


Additional Notes
================

- Improved build system, separate directories for shared and static libraries

- New makefile targets LINKCCSCIPALL and LINKCXXSCIPALL to link all SCIP components into an external project

- Add make help command to list all parameters of the SCIP makefile

- SCIP uses the lpi_spx2 interface by default

- Interfaces for Python and Java are, among others, now available via http://www.github.com/scip-interfaces

- Improved Gurobi interface that can handle ranged rows (requires Gurobi >= 7.0.2)

- New unit testing system built on the Criterion framework

- Revised documentation of the SCIP C-API to group methods more comprehensively by topics

- Many bug fixes, see CHANGELOG
