Notes for SCIP Release 3.2.1


Interface Changes
=================

- SCIPsolveLinearProb now uses a 1-dimensional matrix representation

- renamed MIP matrix structure to SCIP_MATRIX

- changed the numeric values for PRESOLTIMING flags

Features
========

- significantly improved Python interface to support user callbacks
  as well as linear and quadratic expressions

- new interactive shell command "write history" to write the command line history
  (only when compiled with Readline)

- several improvements of SCIP-Jack (STP application)

- several improvements of PolySCIP (former MultiObjective application)

- improved disjunctive cut separator by the 'monoidal cut strengthening'
  procedure of Balas and Jeroslow

Bug Fixes
=========

- handle cutoffs in cons_indicator detected by infeasible inequalities

- fixed wrong objective sense when copying the original problem

- (root) reduced cost propagators are not run anymore when doing branch-and-price,
  since they may install upper bounds on variables which might interfere with the
  pricing (they may be enabled again by their force parameters)

- fixed some problems using reoptimization on infeasible instances or
  instances solved in presolving

- fixed library problems on Windows operating systems

- many small bug fixes, see CHANGELOG
