Notes for SCIP Release 3.1


Features
========

- new primal heuristics random rounding, proximity, and dual value

- new branching rule cloud branching

- added support for strong branching with domain propagation in full strong and
  reliability pseudo cost branching

- new node selectors breadthfirst and uct

- computation of primal-dual integral

- added possibility to add objective offset to original problem

- the original problem can now be copied

- upgrading can now be disabled for single linear constraints

- the rank of cuts is now stored and taken into account to improve numerical stability

- dual solution values can now be obtained in the interactive shell after solving a pure
  LP without presolving

- extended test scripts by statistical tests


Interfaces
==========

- new SoPlex 2.0 interface, can be enabled with LPS=spx2

- beta version of a python interface

- beta version of a Java native interface

- added copy of GAMS interface from COIN-OR/GAMSlinks project;
  GAMS-reader in SCIP can now read model instances from .gms files

- moved LP interfaces to separate directory src/lpi


Performance Improvements and Bug Fixes
======================================

- major improvements in pseudo-boolean constraint handler

- many presolving improvements in constraint handlers

- performance improvement in domain propagation by marking constraints for propagation

- dual fixing presolver was turned into a propagator

- added more constraint upgrading possibilities

- allow multiaggregation of binary variables

- strong branching LP solutions are checked for integrality

- improved handling of initial constraints created during solving

- improved LP reoptimization for branch-and-price applications

- improved numerical stability checks for LP solution

- disabled scaling in feasibility check of nonlinear constraint handlers

- and many bug fixes, see CHANGELOG


Additional Notes
================

- new SCIP Optimization Suite homepages

- new textbook Gomory mixed integer cuts example

- very few interface changes, see CHANGELOG
