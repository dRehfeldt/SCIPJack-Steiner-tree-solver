/**@file   reader_cyc.h
 * @brief  file reader for cycle clustering instances
 * @author Leon Eifler
 *
 * This file implements the reader for the cycle clustering problem. The data is read from a matrix, entries separated
 * by whitespace. The first line in the file has to be of the form "# p nstates ncluster",
 * where nstates is the size of the matrix and ncluster is the number of clusters that should be used.
 * The file has to have the ending ".cyc" to be recognized by the reader.
