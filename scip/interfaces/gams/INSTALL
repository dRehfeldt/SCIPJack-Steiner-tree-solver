This is a copy of the GAMS interface for SCIP

The original sources are found in the COIN-OR/GAMSlinks project at
https://projects.coin-or.org/GAMSlinks .

Note, that any modern GAMS installation includes a relatively up to date
SCIP library, which can be used with any academic GAMS license.

To build and install your own GAMS/SCIP interface, you have to do the following:
 - Adjust GAMSDIR in Makefile or set a symbolic link 'gams' that points to
   the directory of your GAMS distribution.
 - If you use SoPlex, build SoPlex with the flag SHARED=true and make sure
   that SCIPDIR/lib/shared/libsoplex.*.so points to the created SoPlex shared library.
 - Build SCIP with the flags SHARED=true ZIMPL=false READLINE=false and your
   favorite other flags (e.g., IPOPT=true ...).
 - Build the GAMS/SCIP interface in this directory by executing make with
   the same flags that were used to build the SCIP library, i.e.,
   SHARED=true ZIMPL=false READLINE=false and your favorites.
 - The previous step should have created a library ./lib/libgamsscip.*.so.
 - Run make install to make the built GAMS/SCIP interface known to GAMS.
 - You should now be able to use the installed solver by requesting GAMS
   to use solver SCIPDEV for your modeltype.

Notes:
 - The interface requires GAMS >= 24.3.
 - You can also build SCIP and GAMS/SCIP with ZIMPL=true but that requires
   to have build ZIMPL with SHARED=true and having SCIPDIR/lib/shared/libzimpl.*.so
   to point to the ZIMPL shared library (analog to SoPlex).
 - READLINE=false can be necessary to avoid confusion about functions having
   the same name in the readline library and a GAMS library.
 - For documentation on the GAMS/SCIP interface, see
   http://www.gams.com/dd/docs/solvers/scip/index.html
   However, the lp/solver option to choose an LP solver by parameter is
   not available with the interface provided here. If you need it, you can
   check out the GAMSlinks project from COIN-OR and build it.
 - The build system (Makefile) has only been tested on Linux, Windows will
   not be supported.
