This is a very-beta-version of a functional MATLAB/Octave interface for SCIP
Up to now, it has only been tested with SCIP version 2.1.0 and MATLAB version 7.9

It supports solving LPs and MIPs with SCIP that are defined via dense matrices in MATLAB.

Currently not supported, but planned for future versions:
 - sparse data structures
 - setting user parameters in SCIP from MATLAB
 - problem types other than MIP (e.g., quadratic programs)
 - object-oriented interface to interactively manipulate the data structures
 - support of empty constraint set (a rather pathological case)
 - other LP solvers than SoPlex

Please let us know (e-mail to berthold@zib.de and gleixner@zib.de), if you are missing any of these or any other features.
Please let us know if you find any bugs, unexpected behavior, or compatibility problems (report via http://scip.zib.de/bugs.shtml)

To use SCIP from MATLAB, you have to do the following:
 - Compile SoPlex and ZIMPL with 'make ... SHARED=true'
 - Compile SCIP with 'make ... LPS=spx2 SHARED=true'
 - Start MATLAB/Octave from the Matlab interface base directory, e.g., /home/ziboptsuite-2.1.0/scip-2.1.0/interfaces/matlab .
 - Run installscip.
 - If this works fine, you should try to run the example files diet_lp and stein9_ip.
 - Now try your own application.

Further comments:
 - Possibly you have to enter paths to the following files:
   + the SCIP installation, e.g., /home/ziboptsuite-2.1.0/scip-2.1.0
   + the LPI library, e.g., /home/ziboptsuite-2.1.0/scip-2.1.0/lib/liblpispx.a
   + the NLPI library, e.g., /home/ziboptsuite-2.1.0/scip-2.1.0/lib/libnlpispx.a
   + the library for soplex, e.g., libsoplex.linux.x86_64.gnu.opt.a
 - This makes a function called scip available, which has 8 input and two output parameters.

syntax of the function scip:
[bestsol, objval] = scip(matrix, lhs, rhs, obj, lb, ub, vartype, objsense)
input parameters are
   matrix   : real matrix with constraint nonzeros
   lhs      : real vector with left-hand sides of constraints
   rhs      : real vector with right-hand sides of constraints
   obj      : real vector with objective coefficient of variables
   lb       : real vector with lower bounds of variables
   ub       : real vector with upper bounds of variables
   vartype  : character vector with types of variables (b: binary, i: general integer, c: continuous)
   objsense : value indicating optimization sense (+1: minimize, -1: maximize)
output parameters are
   bestsol  : real vector containing best solution found
   objval   : objective function value of best solution found

hints:
 - choose +/- 1e+20 (or bigger) to represent infinite values
 - choose lhs[i]=rhs[i] to represent an equation
 - choose obj = 0 to represent a pure feasibility problem
