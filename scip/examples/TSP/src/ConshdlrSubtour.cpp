 *    (positive) constraint infeasible and rounding up is potentially rendering the negation of the constraint
 *    infeasible.
 *  - If the constraint may get violated by increasing the value of a variable, it should call
 *    SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, var, nlocksneg, nlockspos), saying that rounding up is potentially rendering the
 *    constraint's negation infeasible and rounding up is potentially rendering the constraint itself
 *    infeasible.
 *  - If the constraint may get violated by changing the variable in any direction, it should call
 *    SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, var, nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg).
 *
 *  Consider the linear constraint "3x -5y +2z <= 7" as an example. The variable rounding lock method of the
 *  linear constraint handler should call SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, x, nlocksneg, nlockspos), 
 *  SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, y, nlockspos, nlocksneg) and SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, z, nlocksneg, nlockspos) to tell SCIP,
 *  that rounding up of x and z and rounding down of y can destroy the feasibility of the constraint, while rounding
 *  down of x and z and rounding up of y can destroy the feasibility of the constraint's negation "3x -5y +2z > 7".
 *  A linear constraint "2 <= 3x -5y +2z <= 7" should call
 *  SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, ..., nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg) on all variables, since rounding in both
 *  directions of each variable can destroy both the feasibility of the constraint and it's negation
 *  "3x -5y +2z < 2  or  3x -5y +2z > 7".
 *
 *  If the constraint itself contains other constraints as sub constraints (e.g. the "or" constraint concatenation
 *  "c(x) or d(x)"), the rounding lock methods of these constraints should be called in a proper way.
 *  - If the constraint may get violated by the violation of the sub constraint c, it should call
 *    SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, c, nlockspos, nlocksneg), saying that infeasibility of c may lead to infeasibility of
 *    the (positive) constraint, and infeasibility of c's negation (i.e. feasibility of c) may lead to infeasibility
 *    of the constraint's negation (i.e. feasibility of the constraint).
 *  - If the constraint may get violated by the feasibility of the sub constraint c, it should call
 *    SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, c, nlocksneg, nlockspos), saying that infeasibility of c may lead to infeasibility of
 *    the constraint's negation (i.e. feasibility of the constraint), and infeasibility of c's negation (i.e. feasibility
 *    of c) may lead to infeasibility of the (positive) constraint.
 *  - If the constraint may get violated by any change in the feasibility of the sub constraint c, it should call
 *    SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, c, nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg).
 *
 *  Consider the or concatenation "c(x) or d(x)". The variable rounding lock method of the or constraint handler
 *  should call SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, c, nlockspos, nlocksneg) and SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, d, nlockspos, nlocksneg)
 *  to tell SCIP, that infeasibility of c and d can lead to infeasibility of "c(x) or d(x)".
 *
 *  As a second example, consider the equivalence constraint "y <-> c(x)" with variable y and constraint c. The
 *  constraint demands, that y == 1 if and only if c(x) is satisfied. The variable lock method of the corresponding
 *  constraint handler should call SCIPaddVarLocks(scip, y, nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg) and
 *  SCIPaddConsLocks(scip, c, nlockspos + nlocksneg, nlockspos + nlocksneg), because any modification to the
 *  value of y or to the feasibility of c can alter the feasibility of the equivalence constraint.
