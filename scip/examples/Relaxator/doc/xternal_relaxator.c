/**@page RELAXATOR_MAIN Relaxator Example
 * @author   Benjamin Mueller
 *
 * This example illustrates how to write a relaxator for SCIP. It extends the default plugins of <a
 * href="http://scip.zib.de">SCIP</a> by two additional relaxator plugins, one for solving the linear and another one
 * for solving the convex nonlinear relaxation. Both relaxators are called in each node of the branch-and-bound tree.
