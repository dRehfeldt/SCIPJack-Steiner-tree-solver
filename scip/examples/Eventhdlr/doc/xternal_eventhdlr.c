/**@page     EVENTHDLR_MAIN
 * @author   Stefan Heinz
 *
 * This example illustrates the use of an event handler within \SCIP. It extends the
 * default plugins of \SCIP by two additional plugins, namely an event handler which
 * reacts on new best solutions and an event handler acting on processed nodes. You should also read the section
 * \ref EVENT which explains event handling in general.
 *
 * The event handlers event_bestsol.c and event_boundwriting.c show how the create a customized event handler in \SCIP.
 * In case of an event handler, there are two important questions to answer:
 *  -# When to \a install the event handler and
 *  -# When to \a remove the event handler.
 *
 * <b>Note:</b> You can replace the event type in this example with any none-variable event. See
 * in the type_event.h in the SCIP documentation for a
 * complete list.
 *
 * The remainder of this page focusses on the best solution event handler. See event_boundwriting.c for
 * a documentation of the bound writing event handler.
 *
 * @section INSTALL_EVENTHDLR Installing the event handler
 *
 * In the following we describe the use of the callback methods of all event handler
 * for the installation of our event handler.
 *
 * In this example, we want to install an event handler which reacts on a new best solution.
 *
 * Our goal is to specify that our event_bestsol.c event handler reacts
 * on the SCIP_EVENTTYPE_BESTSOLFOUND which already exists in SCIP. The main methods for changing the way
 * SCIP notifies the event handler about an event are
 * - SCIPcatchEvent() to be informed about new events
 * - SCIPdropEvent() to drop the event
 *
 * The right callback
 * event handler in the callback SCIP_DECL_EVENTINIT. At that point the problem was tranformed. Note that there are
 * heuristics which are called before even the presolving starts as for example the trivial heuristic. This means the callback
 * SCIP_DECL_EVENTINTSOL is too late to install the solution event because at that stage, we might have already missed
 * several solutions.
 *
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_EVENTINIT(eventInitBestsol)
 * {
 *    assert(scip != NULL);
 *    assert(eventhdlr != NULL);
 *    assert(strcmp(SCIPeventhdlrGetName(eventhdlr), EVENTHDLR_NAME) == 0);
 *
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPcatchEvent( scip, SCIP_EVENTTYPE_BESTSOLFOUND, eventhdlr, NULL, NULL) );
 *
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The method SCIPcatchEvent() notifies \SCIP that we want to react on the event type best solution found.
 *
 * @section REMOVE Remove the event handler
 *
 * With respect to dropping the event handling, we perform that action in SCIP_DECL_EVENTEXIT which is the counter part
 * of SCIP_DECL_EVENTINIT. The callback SCIP_DECL_EVENTEXITSOL which is the counter part to SCIP_DECL_EVENTINTSOL does
 * not work because it will be called before the branch-and-bound process is freed. This, however, is not only done
 * after the problem is solved. It also happens when a restart is performed. Dropping the event handler within this
 * method would cause our event handler not to be informed about every new solution found after the first restart.
 * Therefore, the right
 * place to drop that event handler is the callback SCIP_DECL_EVENTEXIT. Below you find the source code.
 *
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_EVENTEXIT(eventExitBestsol)
 * {
 *    assert(scip != NULL);
 *    assert(eventhdlr != NULL);
 *    assert(strcmp(SCIPeventhdlrGetName(eventhdlr), EVENTHDLR_NAME) == 0);
 *
 *    SCIP_CALL( SCIPdropEvent( scip, SCIP_EVENTTYPE_BESTSOLFOUND, eventhdlr, NULL, -1) );
 *    return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The method SCIPdropEvent() tells SCIP that we want to drop the event type SCIP_EVENTTYPE_BESTSOLFOUND of belonging
 * to the event handler.
 *
 * @section REACT React on events
 *
 * In the callback SCIP_DECL_EVENTEXEC, which is the execution method of the event handler, you can specify how the
 * event handler reacts on an event it catches. In this case, we just want to output a line to the console
 * every time a new best solution is found.
 *
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_DECL_EVENTEXEC(eventExecBestsol)
 * {
 *   SCIP_SOL* bestsol;
 *   SCIP_Real solvalue;
 *
 *   assert(eventhdlr != NULL);
 *   assert(strcmp(SCIPeventhdlrGetName(eventhdlr), EVENTHDLR_NAME) == 0);
 *   assert(event != NULL);
 *   assert(scip != NULL);
 *   assert(SCIPeventGetType(event) == SCIP_EVENTTYPE_BESTSOLFOUND);
 *
 *   SCIPdebugMessage("exec method of event handler for best solution found\n");
 *
 *   bestsol = SCIPgetBestSol(scip);
 *   assert(bestsol != NULL);
 *   solvalue = SCIPgetSolOrigObj(scip, bestsol);
 *
 *   SCIPinfoMessage(scip, NULL, "found new best solution with solution value <%g>\n", solvalue);
 *
 *   return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 *
 * @section ADDING Including the event handler plugin
 *
 * \SCIP is plugin-based. This means that all plugins which should be used have be
 * included into the \SCIP environment. In the case of the event handler, we are doing
 * this after the \SCIP environment was created (see cmain.c).
 *
 * \code
 * static
 * SCIP_RETCODE runShell(
 *   int                        argc,
 *   char**                     argv,
 *   const char*                defaultsetname
 *   )
 * {
 *   SCIP* scip = NULL;
 *
 *   SCIP_CALL( SCIPcreate(&scip) );
 *
 *   SCIP_CALL( SCIPincludeDefaultPlugins(scip) );
 *
 *   SCIP_CALL( SCIPincludeEventHdlrBestsol(scip) );
 *   SCIP_CALL( SCIPincludeEventHdlrBoundwriting(scip) );
 *
 *   SCIP_CALL( SCIPprocessShellArguments(scip, argc, argv, defaultsetname) );
 *
 *   SCIP_CALL( SCIPfree(&scip) );
 *
 *   BMScheckEmptyMemory();
 *
 *   return SCIP_OKAY;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
