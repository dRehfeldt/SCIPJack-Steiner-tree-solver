# UPDATE:

As new Soplex and SCIP versions are available, and this repository cannot be constantly kept up to date, the corresponding folders 
have been removed. To use this repository, please get the latest SCIP and Soplex versions from https://scip.zib.de/ and add the sources in folders "scip" and "soplex". Alternatively, you can directly use the SCIP-Jack version that is part of SCIP and is also available here: https://scip.zib.de/.
